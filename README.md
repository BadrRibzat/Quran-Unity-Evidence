# Quran Unity Evidence 📖 ➡️ 📱

> **Bridging Divine Revelations Through Evidence-Based Scriptural Harmony**

## 🎯 Vision

**Quran Unity Evidence** is an open-source mobile application that presents a scholarly, evidence-based exploration of the continuity and unity of divine messages across the Torah, Bible, and Quran. By cross-referencing verses, analyzing thematic parallels, and providing historical-linguistic context, this project aims to foster deeper understanding of the shared spiritual heritage of Abrahamic faiths.

> *"Indeed, this Quran guides to that which is most suitable and gives good tidings to the believers who do righteous deeds that they will have a great reward."*  
> — **Quran 17:9**
